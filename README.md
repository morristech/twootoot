### Info
This project is aimed at achieving a basic twitter integration complete with some basic user interaction listed below using no frameworks.
Why no frameworks? Well just to show some good'ol Java knowledge.
* Create a clean UX/UI design [logo, colors, fonts, branding, etc]
* Manual implementation of OAuth and Twitter api, manual HTTP implementation.. and no dependency injection.
* Initial goal is to duplicate this repo once it's final using _State of the Art_ libs available for Android - like RxJava and Squares awesome libs. If I can find the time.
* Feature a design fit for 2016, just to differ from the official Twitter client.

### Features & functionality

* Login
* View feed
* Retweet
* Answer tweet
* Keep position in feed (list) on orientation change
* Portrait
  * Swipe retweet/answer
* Landscape
  * Swipe retweet/answer
