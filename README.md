# twootoot [a frameworkless-ish twitter client]
_Achieving excellence one tweet at a time._

## Breakdown
### Info
This project is aimed at achieving a basic twitter integration complete with some basic user interaction listed below using no frameworks.
Why no frameworks? Well just to show some good'ol Java knowledge.
* No use of OAuth or official Twitter libs, no HTTP libs.. and no dependency injection :(
* Initial goal is to duplicate this repo once it's final using _State of the Art_ libs available for Android... like RxJava and Squares awesome libs. If I can find the time.
* Implementing a design fit for 2016 is a _requirement_, just to differ from the official Twitter client.
